For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.    1\n",
